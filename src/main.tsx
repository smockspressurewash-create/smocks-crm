// AUDIT 1 — the only ErrorBoundary in the app previously lived INSIDE App.tsx
// wrapping just the routed CRM page content (<SafePage>). Every other render
// path — the header/sidebar/notifications shell around it, plus the early
// `return <EmployeePortal/>` / <ClientAuthPortal/> / <ReferralLanding/> /
// <CustomerReviewPage/> / <ResetPassword/> branches in App.tsx that run
// BEFORE that boundary is ever reached — had nothing catching a thrown error.
// React unmounts the whole tree on an uncaught render error, and index.css
// sets the page background to near-black (#050505), so any one of those
// throwing produced exactly a silent black screen with only a console error.
// Wrapping the single root render call here is the one change that protects
// every path at once, including ones added in the future.

// Mount immediately — React renders from cached (localStorage) state right
// away; auth resolves in the background via App.tsx's own onAuthStateChange
// listener and getSession() call. This used to `await` (with a 3s timeout
// fallback) supabase.auth.initialize() before the FIRST render() call, which
// meant an unstyled, un-mounted #root against the near-black body background
// (index.css `background: #050505`) for up to 3 seconds on every reload — a
// real, visible black-screen delay, not a perceived one. Firing it without
// awaiting removes that delay entirely; any failure is just logged, never
// blocks rendering.

// browsers without SW support (Safari has partial support; this just
// silently skips there).

// Haptic feedback on every tap, app-wide — one listener here covers the
// owner CRM, employee portal, and client portal alike (all mount under this
// single root). Real ticks on Android; a harmless no-op on iOS (see
// lib/haptics.ts's comment — that's a WebKit platform limitation, not
// something fixable here).
